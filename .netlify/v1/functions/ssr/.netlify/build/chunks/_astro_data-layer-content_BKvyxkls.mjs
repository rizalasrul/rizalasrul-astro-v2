Without effective communication, brilliant ideas will go to waste.\n\nAs developers, we communicate at all levels. We spend hours in meetings, conversing with teammates, and meeting with end users to understand their needs. We also write code, which is our way of communicating with machines. On top of that, we create diagrams or memos to update teams or give advice. In the end, most of our day is spent communicating in various forms. So, getting it right is essential.\n\nTreat communication like coding. Write it like you would write code: follow principles like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and ETC (Easier to Change).\n\n> English is just another programming language.\n\n## Know Your Audience\n\nWe only communicate when we have information to share. To do that, we need to understand the other person’s needs, interests, and abilities. Imagine you're in a meeting where the product engineers are lecturing the VP of Marketing about microservices. That's not communication; it's a boring lecture.\n\nWhen presenting something like using microservices for an upcoming campaign, tailor your explanation to your audience. For example, explain that using microservices will make it easier for customers to find campaign banners right on the homepage, and for the marketing team to upload banners tailored to the target market. This helps everyone understand the benefits, from marketing managers to non-tech folks, making them excited about the project.\n\n## Know What You Want to Say\n\n| ![Photo by Kyle Glenn on Unsplash](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*g_WePnatBfuWFO4s) |\n|:--:| \n| **Photo by Kyle Glenn on Unsplash** |\n\nSometimes the hardest part of communication is figuring out what you want to say. Just like novelists plan their books, technical writers should outline their ideas. Before writing, ask yourself, “Does this message make sense for the audience?” Then revise until it's clear.\n\nThis applies not just to writing documents but also to meetings or calls. Jot down key points and plan how to present them effectively.\n\n## Choose the Right Moment\n\nPicture this: it's 6 PM on a Friday. Some coworkers are packing up, eager to start the weekend. This isn’t the best time to ask for a code review.\n\nPart of knowing your audience is understanding their priorities. On Friday, people are likely winding down, so it's better to wait until Monday to ask for help with a code review.\n\nSometimes, a simple “Is now a good time?” can go a long way.\n\n## Choose Your Style\n\nAdjust your writing style to the person you're communicating with. Some people prefer short and direct messages, while others enjoy long discussions before getting to the point. Consider their expertise level as well — are they experts or beginners?\n\nIf someone is struggling with your communication style, be open to feedback. It helps you improve.\n\n## Make It Look Good\n\n> Your ideas are important. They deserve a good-looking vehicle to convey them to your audience.\n\nMany software engineers focus only on content, but presentation matters. How you convey the message, the words you choose, and the layout of your paragraphs all play a role in how comfortable and engaged the reader is.\n\n| ![Photo by siriwan arunsiriwattana on Unsplash](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*mn9DRYbazuhdlNJZ) |\n|:--:| \n| **Photo by siriwan arunsiriwattana on Unsplash** |\n\nThere's no excuse for bad documentation these days. Modern software tools help produce good output, whether you're using markdown or a word processor. Learn some basic commands, use consistent styles, and pay attention to spelling and formatting.\n\n## Involve Your Audience\n\nSometimes, the process of producing a document is more important than the document itself. If possible, involve the target audience from the start and gather their feedback. This builds a strong working relationship and ensures the document is useful.\n\n## Be a Listener\n\nThe key to getting people to listen to us is simple: **listen to them first**. When we’re the expert in a room, it’s easy to talk over people, but if we don't listen to them, they won’t listen to us.\n\nEncourage them to speak by asking questions or summarizing what you've said. Turn one-sided meetings into a dialogue.\n\n## Get Back to People\n\nIf we ask someone a question, they’ll feel rude if they don’t respond. But how often do we fail to reply to others via email or memo? In the daily grind, it's easy to forget to follow up.\n\nIf you receive an email, respond as soon as possible, even if it's just to say, “I’ll get back to you later.” It makes the other person feel heard and valued.\n\nThe goal is to make communication effective, even if it's not face-to-face.\n\n## Documentation\n\nSoftware engineers often overlook documentation. It’s seen as an afterthought, with feature development taking priority. But documentation is an essential part of the development process.\n\nGood documentation makes work easier, reducing time spent on repetitive tasks or “copy-pasting.” \n\nYou can create effective documentation by adding comments to your code. But don't go overboard with comments in every function or data structure. If the code is clear, it shouldn't need excessive explanation.","src/content/blog/communicating-as-an-engineer.md","aacc93cb5c304be0",{html:23,metadata:24},"<h2 id=\"why-communication-matters\">Why Communication Matters</h2>\n<p>When communication fails, team members struggle to understand what makes them more efficient because they miss out on feedback from others.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I believe that it is better to be looked over than it is to be overlooked.” — Mae West, <em>Belle of the Nineties</em>, 1934</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This quote reminds us that it’s not just about having the best ideas or approaches; if we can’t share them, they lose their value.

No dogma\nA pragmatic programmer is technology-agnostic, using the best tools for the job and not sticking to one set of tools or systems.\n\n## 2. Great power, great curiosity\nSoftware engineers have significant autonomy. Good engineers care about their craft and think critically about their work.\n\n## 3. Good-enough software\n\"Good enough\" doesn't mean sloppy. It means meeting user requirements efficiently while being mindful of time constraints. Always involve the user in trade-off decisions.\n\n## 4. No broken windows\nQuality is a team responsibility. Leaving issues unresolved sends a bad message. Continually refactor and fix bugs as you encounter them.\n\n## 5. Let it crash\nLet programs crash early to avoid hidden issues. Defensive programming can create more problems; if it’s going to crash, let it crash.\n\n## 6. Decouple your code\nDecouple your code to make it more flexible. It’s easier to maintain and less disruptive when changes are required.\n\n## 7. Coding is non-mechanical\nCoding isn’t just about transcribing design to code. It’s about continuously improving and thinking ahead to ensure the software’s longevity.\n\n## 8. Keep it simple\nSimplicity aids maintainability, reduces complexity, and makes the code safer. Simpler designs are less prone to bugs and security issues.\n\n## 9. Be a therapist\nHelp clients clarify their needs by engaging in a feedback loop. Don’t trust their first statement of requirements—help them define the real problem.\n\n## 10. Don’t panic\nIf coding feels tough, take a break. Reassess the design and the problem. Sometimes stepping back is the best way to simplify and find a solution.\n\n---\n\nIn conclusion, being a pragmatic programmer is about balancing quality with simplicity, helping the team thrive, and taking responsibility for the work you do.\n\n> This article is part of the 30 Day Writing Challenge.

In fact, things got really bad in Indonesia this year — probably the worst so far. There was sad news everywhere, even from people close to me.\n\n2021 was a tough year personally too. My brother got Covid and had to isolate at Wisma Atlet. I lost a friend. Many others around me were affected as well. It was depressing — for everyone.\n\nStill, as I look back from January to now, I realize there are things I can be grateful for. Even in difficult times, there are always small things to appreciate.\n\n## Working from home\n\nI’ve been working from home all year. My company decided early on that we’d continue WFH for 2021.\n\nAnd honestly, I’m super thankful for that. Working from home has been great for flexibility, saving money, and even improving how I communicate.\n\n## Got promoted\n\nThis year I got promoted! I felt happy, of course, but also a bit unsure about what to do next.\n\nLuckily, my manager and lead were really helpful. They gave me a lot of direct feedback and support in our 1-on-1s.\n\n## Worked on the SIPLah project\n\nI got pulled into the SIPLah project for a few months mid-year. It’s a platform created by the Ministry of Education to help schools with procurement.\n\nThe project was challenging — lots of changing requirements and new processes to learn. But I learned a lot and grew from the experience.\n\n## Azure migration experience\n\nBukalapak partnered with Microsoft, and we started migrating services to Azure.\n\nI got the chance to work on this project. I migrated two micro-frontends and mentored another engineer as a cloud coach. It was cool working with new people from outside my squad.\n\n## Learned about tech debt management\n\nI used to think the only way to handle tech debt was to pay it off ASAP.\n\nBut this year, I joined an internal training on managing tech debt — and it changed my perspective. I learned how to measure complexity, prioritize, and present the info clearly to stakeholders.\n\n## Spoke at Kemah Budaya Kaum Muda\n\nIn July, I was invited to speak at a webinar held by the Ministry of Education. It was part of an event called Kemah Budaya Kaum Muda (KBKM).\n\nIt was a fun experience sharing my thoughts on software engineering and how we build impactful tech quickly.\n\n## Read more books\n\nLike I shared in the previous post, I read way more books this year than last year. I even made mini summaries and posted them on Instagram. Hope I can keep it up next year!\n\n## Wrote more\n\nThis blog helped me write more consistently. I also wrote more at work — RFCs, SADs, and documentation.\n\nWriting turned out to be a big part of software engineering. It’s not just about code.\n\n## Got vaccinated\n\nMy whole family got vaccinated this year. My company helped organize a smooth vaccination process for employees and their families. Super grateful for that.\n\n## Discovered great podcasts\n\nI’ve been listening to more podcasts than music while working from home. Some favorites: Endgame by Gita Wirjawan and Tech Lead Journal by Henry Suryawirawan. Highly recommend!\n\n## Went back to the cinema\n\nI didn’t go to the movies at all last year, but finally went again this year. Thought Spider-Man: No Way Home would be the first one — turns out it was Venom: Let There Be Carnage.\n\n## Still investing\n\nI’m thankful I could continue investing. I even opened another account this year to reach new financial goals. Hoping I can stay consistent with this habit.\n\n## Health\n\nDespite everything, my family and I stayed healthy. My wife and I didn’t catch Covid. That’s something I’ll always be grateful for.\n\n--\n\nI’m sure you also have your own list of things to be thankful for.

And that matters a lot more than people think.</p>\n<p>If you think building wealth requires a high income or big investment wins, it can feel overwhelming and out of reach.

For the next 30 days, I’ll be writing about anything that comes to mind—no rules, no word counts, and definitely no pressure. Just pure, consistent writing practice.\n\nLet’s get started with something close to heart: the things I learned when I first joined Bukalapak.\n\n## Vanilla JavaScript? Oh, You Mean *Real* JavaScript\n\nBefore joining Bukalapak, jQuery was my best friend. Need to manipulate the DOM? `$('.my #awesome selector')` had me covered. But here, I had to get used to writing plain, old-school JavaScript—no shortcuts, no sugarcoating.\n\nSuddenly, `document.querySelectorAll('.my #awesome selector')` became part of my daily life.\n\nFunny thing is, during the interview, I was asked to solve a problem using only JavaScript. I thought it was just an interview gimmick. Turns out, it's part of the culture here—knowing your fundamentals matters.\n\n## Hello, Vue!\n\nVue was the frontend framework of choice at Bukalapak. Coming from an environment where I didn’t use any frontend frameworks, this was a whole new world for me.\n\nLearning Vue opened my eyes to how much cleaner and more maintainable frontend code can be. It was challenging at first, but also exciting—like upgrading from a flip phone to a smartphone.\n\n## Git & GitHub: More Than Just Commands\n\nI was introduced to Git at the end of my college years, around 2015. Back then, it was just a concept I didn’t really need to use. At my previous job, Git wasn’t even part of the workflow.\n\nThat changed fast at Bukalapak. Not only did I have to master Git commands like `git pull`, `git push`, and `git status`, but I also learned how GitHub workflows actually work in a team setting—branches, pull requests, code reviews, the whole nine yards.\n\n## Living the AGILE Life\n\nI first heard about AGILE during a Software Engineering class in 2013. The concept sounded futuristic and kind of mysterious at the time. My lecturer mentioned it, but we never got to apply it in real projects.\n\nAt Bukalapak, AGILE wasn’t just a buzzword—it was our daily routine. I still remember my first sprint. When the PM asked me for story points, I stared blankly and thought, *“Story what now?”*\n\nIt took some getting used to, but being part of an AGILE team taught me how to work more collaboratively, communicate better, and break down complex work into manageable pieces.\n\n---\n\nThat’s it for today.

You can always reframe what you want to say to communicate more effectively.\n\nIntroverts may prefer working solo, but we still need to be able to work in teams. If you're feeling left out, use your observational skills to understand what your teammates need and offer help where you can.\n\n---\n\nStanding out at work as an introvert takes practice, but it’s worth it.

You might be tempted to write, “Hi all, no need to reply now—just read this on Monday…”\n\nInstead of sending messages during off-hours, try using Slack’s **scheduled messages** feature. You can compose your message and choose a specific date and time for it to be delivered—whether you’re at your desk or still enjoying your Sunday morning coffee.\n\n## Draft First, Send Later\n\nIf you’re not quite ready to send a message—perhaps you’re unsure about the content or timing—consider writing it as a draft. Slack automatically saves these unsent messages in a **Drafts** section in your sidebar. This makes it easy to return to them when you’re ready to review and send.\n\n## Refine Your Searches\n\nCan’t remember which channel or person you messaged? Slack’s search bar can help you find what you’re looking for by using helpful prefixes.\n\nHere are some useful search examples:\n\n- `from:@herman taxes` – to find messages from Herman that mention \"taxes\".\n- `in:#finance salaries` – to locate salary-related discussions in the #finance channel.\n\nOver time, Slack becomes a searchable archive of valuable conversations and decisions—use it well.\n\n## Default to Public Channels When Possible\n\nIf your discussion involves multiple teams or could benefit others, consider using a **public channel**. This keeps conversations transparent and accessible. It’s especially helpful when team members transition or leave—anyone can trace back the context and decisions without needing to dig through private messages.\n\n## Avoid Sending Just “Hi” or “Halo Mas”\n\nWe've all seen this happen:\n\n```\n2021-12-24 12:32:12 You: Hi\n2021-12-24 12:32:15 Colleague: Hello.\n# COLLEAGUE WAITS WHILE YOU PHRASE YOUR QUESTION\n2021-12-24 12:34:01 You: I'm working on [something] and I'm trying to do [etc...]\n2021-12-24 12:35:21 Colleague: Oh, that's [answer...]\n```\n\nIn a real-time conversation or phone call, this is fine. But Slack supports **asynchronous communication**—it’s okay to get straight to the point.

You might be tempted to write, “Hi all, no need to reply now—just read this on Monday…”</p>\n<p>Instead of sending messages during off-hours, try using Slack’s <strong>scheduled messages</strong> feature. You can compose your message and choose a specific date and time for it to be delivered—whether you’re at your desk or still enjoying your Sunday morning coffee.</p>\n<h2 id=\"draft-first-send-later\">Draft First, Send Later</h2>\n<p>If you’re not quite ready to send a message—perhaps you’re unsure about the content or timing—consider writing it as a draft. Slack automatically saves these unsent messages in a <strong>Drafts</strong> section in your sidebar. This makes it easy to return to them when you’re ready to review and send.</p>\n<h2 id=\"refine-your-searches\">Refine Your Searches</h2>\n<p>Can’t remember which channel or person you messaged? Slack’s search bar can help you find what you’re looking for by using helpful prefixes.</p>\n<p>Here are some useful search examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>from:@herman taxes</code> – to find messages from Herman that mention “taxes”.</li>\n<li><code>in:#finance salaries</code> – to locate salary-related discussions in the #finance channel.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Over time, Slack becomes a searchable archive of valuable conversations and decisions—use it well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"default-to-public-channels-when-possible\">Default to Public Channels When Possible</h2>\n<p>If your discussion involves multiple teams or could benefit others, consider using a <strong>public channel</strong>. This keeps conversations transparent and accessible. It’s especially helpful when team members transition or leave—anyone can trace back the context and decisions without needing to dig through private messages.</p>\n<h2 id=\"avoid-sending-just-hi-or-halo-mas\">Avoid Sending Just “Hi” or “Halo Mas”</h2>\n<p>We’ve all seen this happen:</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"plaintext\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>2021-12-24 12:32:12 You: Hi</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>2021-12-24 12:32:15 Colleague: Hello.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span># COLLEAGUE WAITS WHILE YOU PHRASE YOUR QUESTION</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>2021-12-24 12:34:01 You: I'm working on [something] and I'm trying to do [etc...]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>2021-12-24 12:35:21 Colleague: Oh, that's [answer...]</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>In a real-time conversation or phone call, this is fine.

Anyone can Google the term, but here’s an example to illustrate.\n\nImagine someone asks, “What time is it?”\n\nLiterally, they’re asking for the time, and our response is simply “It’s seven o’clock at night.”\n\nHowever, pragmatically, they might actually be asking, “Why are you late?” In this case, we would answer with an explanation rather than just the time.\n\nAnother example: someone asks, “Can you pass me the bottle of sweet soy sauce?”\n\nLiterally, they're asking if we can hand it over. But pragmatically, what they’re really asking is, “Could you please pass me the sweet soy sauce?” So, instead of replying with \"yes\" or \"no,\" we would just pass it to them.\n\n## So, What Makes a Pragmatic Programmer?\n\nEvery developer is unique, with their own strengths, weaknesses, and preferences. As time passes, they create their own working environment, which reflects their personality as much as their hobbies and appearance. However, a pragmatic programmer tends to exhibit these traits:\n\n### Early Adopter/Fast Adapter\n\nWe have an instinct for technology and enjoy experimenting with new tools. We can quickly pick up new technologies and integrate them with what we already know, building confidence from experience.\n\n### High Curiosity\n\nWe love to ask questions like, “Your code is so clean! How do you do that? What challenges did you face with this library? How did you implement it?” We’re like pack rats for small facts, each potentially influencing a decision in the future.\n\n### Critical Thinker\n\nWe never accept tasks without understanding their purpose. If a task is presented as something that will help many people, we see it as a challenge, prompting us to analyze the problem deeper.\n\n### Realistic\n\nWe always try to get to the root cause of problems. This realism helps us gauge how difficult a task is and how long it will take, allowing us to make realistic plans and set expectations.\n\n### Generalist\n\nWhile we may specialize in one field, we strive to stay familiar with various technologies and trends. This flexibility allows us to easily move into new areas and face new challenges.\n\n---\n\nIn addition to these characteristics, two fundamental qualities define a pragmatic programmer:\n\n1. **Care About Your Craft**  \n   Developing software is only meaningful if we approach it with care and caution.\n   \n2. **Think About Your Work**  \n   Instead of running on autopilot, we stay engaged with our current projects, always thinking critically about what we're doing. We apply the mantra: THINK.\n\n## Pragmatic Individual in a Big Team\n\nSome believe that individuality has no place in large teams or complex projects. They argue that software construction is an engineering discipline, and it falls apart when individuals make decisions on their own.\n\nThis isn’t true.\n\nWhile software development is an engineering discipline, it doesn’t mean we must suppress individual expertise. Take the example of a museum built over many decades. The construction was carried out by countless individuals, each contributing based on their own knowledge and abilities, without sacrificing their personal contributions to the team.\n\n## The Point Is a Continuous Process\n\n> A tourist visiting the Bogor Botanical Gardens asked the gardener how he made the grass so beautiful.  \n> “It’s easy,” said the gardener. “You just water it every day, mow it every afternoon, and clean the dirt around the grass once a week.”  \n> “That’s all?” said the tourist.  \n> “Of course,” replied the gardener casually. “Do that for ten years, and you’ll have a beautiful garden.”\n\nCreating something beautiful, like the grass in the Bogor Botanical Gardens, takes consistent daily effort. The same goes for being a great programmer.\n\nIn Japan, the term *kaizen* is often used, meaning “continuous improvement.” It’s a concept that has greatly contributed to Japan’s manufacturing success and has been widely adopted globally.\n\n*Kaizen* applies to individuals as well. Every day, we should aim to improve our skills, even if only in small ways. Unlike the decade-long growth of the garden, we’ll see improvements in our skills within a matter of days.
