	<p>This is my "Now Page," where I share what I'm up to lately. I'll try to keep it updated, but I might forget — hopefully not!</p>

	<h2>Latest Update</h2>
	<p>Right now, I'm working as a <strong>Software Engineer, Frontend</strong> at <strong>Tiket</strong>. I've been to Japan three times, spent 45 days there, and visited 14 prefectures. I'm also preparing for my <strong>relocation to Japan</strong> soon.</p>

	<h2>Work</h2>
	<p>I'm focused on improving my frontend skills and contributing to projects at Tiket.</p>

	<h2>Personal</h2>
	<p>When I'm not coding, I'm playing <strong>Coral Island</strong>, a game from Indonesia. I'm also running 5 km a day as part of <strong>#zaljalan</strong>, though I've been a bit inconsistent lately. Hoping to get back on track!</p>
