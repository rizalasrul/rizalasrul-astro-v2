## Why Communication Matters

When communication fails, team members struggle to understand what makes them more efficient because they miss out on feedback from others.

> "I believe that it is better to be looked over than it is to be overlooked." — Mae West, *Belle of the Nineties*, 1934

This quote reminds us that it's not just about having the best ideas or approaches; if we can't share them, they lose their value. Without effective communication, brilliant ideas will go to waste.

As developers, we communicate at all levels. We spend hours in meetings, conversing with teammates, and meeting with end users to understand their needs. We also write code, which is our way of communicating with machines. On top of that, we create diagrams or memos to update teams or give advice. In the end, most of our day is spent communicating in various forms. So, getting it right is essential.

Treat communication like coding. Write it like you would write code: follow principles like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and ETC (Easier to Change).

> English is just another programming language.

## Know Your Audience

We only communicate when we have information to share. To do that, we need to understand the other person’s needs, interests, and abilities. Imagine you're in a meeting where the product engineers are lecturing the VP of Marketing about microservices. That's not communication; it's a boring lecture.

When presenting something like using microservices for an upcoming campaign, tailor your explanation to your audience. For example, explain that using microservices will make it easier for customers to find campaign banners right on the homepage, and for the marketing team to upload banners tailored to the target market. This helps everyone understand the benefits, from marketing managers to non-tech folks, making them excited about the project.

## Know What You Want to Say

Sometimes the hardest part of communication is figuring out what you want to say. Just like novelists plan their books, technical writers should outline their ideas. Before writing, ask yourself, “Does this message make sense for the audience?” Then revise until it's clear.

This applies not just to writing documents but also to meetings or calls. Jot down key points and plan how to present them effectively.

## Choose the Right Moment

Picture this: it's 6 PM on a Friday. Some coworkers are packing up, eager to start the weekend. This isn’t the best time to ask for a code review.

Part of knowing your audience is understanding their priorities. On Friday, people are likely winding down, so it's better to wait until Monday to ask for help with a code review.

Sometimes, a simple “Is now a good time?” can go a long way.

## Choose Your Style

Adjust your writing style to the person you're communicating with. Some people prefer short and direct messages, while others enjoy long discussions before getting to the point. Consider their expertise level as well — are they experts or beginners?

If someone is struggling with your communication style, be open to feedback. It helps you improve.

## Make It Look Good

> Your ideas are important. They deserve a good-looking vehicle to convey them to your audience.

Many software engineers focus only on content, but presentation matters. How you convey the message, the words you choose, and the layout of your paragraphs all play a role in how comfortable and engaged the reader is.

There's no excuse for bad documentation these days. Modern software tools help produce good output, whether you're using markdown or a word processor. Learn some basic commands, use consistent styles, and pay attention to spelling and formatting.

## Involve Your Audience

Sometimes, the process of producing a document is more important than the document itself. If possible, involve the target audience from the start and gather their feedback. This builds a strong working relationship and ensures the document is useful.

## Be a Listener

The key to getting people to listen to us is simple: **listen to them first**. When we’re the expert in a room, it’s easy to talk over people, but if we don't listen to them, they won’t listen to us.

Encourage them to speak by asking questions or summarizing what you've said. Turn one-sided meetings into a dialogue.

## Get Back to People

If we ask someone a question, they’ll feel rude if they don’t respond. But how often do we fail to reply to others via email or memo? In the daily grind, it's easy to forget to follow up.

If you receive an email, respond as soon as possible, even if it's just to say, “I’ll get back to you later.” It makes the other person feel heard and valued.

The goal is to make communication effective, even if it's not face-to-face.

## Documentation

Software engineers often overlook documentation. It’s seen as an afterthought, with feature development taking priority. But documentation is an essential part of the development process.

Good documentation makes work easier, reducing time spent on repetitive tasks or “copy-pasting.” 

You can create effective documentation by adding comments to your code. But don't go overboard with comments in every function or data structure. If the code is clear, it shouldn't need excessive explanation.
