## Why Communication Matters

When communication fails, team members struggle to understand what makes them more efficient because they miss out on feedback from others.

> "I believe that it is better to be looked over than it is to be overlooked." — Mae West, *Belle of the Nineties*, 1934

This quote reminds us that it's not just about having the best ideas or approaches; if we can't share them, they lose their value. Without effective communication, brilliant ideas will go to waste.

As developers, we communicate at all levels. We spend hours in meetings, conversing with teammates, and meeting with end users to understand their needs. We also write code, which is our way of communicating with machines. On top of that, we create diagrams or memos to update teams or give advice. In the end, most of our day is spent communicating in various forms. So, getting it right is essential.

Treat communication like coding. Write it like you would write code: follow principles like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and ETC (Easier to Change).

> English is just another programming language.

## Know Your Audience

We only communicate when we have information to share. To do that, we need to understand the other person’s needs, interests, and abilities. Imagine you're in a meeting where the product engineers are lecturing the VP of Marketing about microservices. That's not communication; it's a boring lecture.

When presenting something like using microservices for an upcoming campaign, tailor your explanation to your audience. For example, explain that using microservices will make it easier for customers to find campaign banners right on the homepage, and for the marketing team to upload banners tailored to the target market. This helps everyone understand the benefits, from marketing managers to non-tech folks, making them excited about the project.

## Know What You Want to Say

Sometimes the hardest part of communication is figuring out what you want to say. Just like novelists plan their books, technical writers should outline their ideas. Before writing, ask yourself, “Does this message make sense for the audience?” Then revise until it's clear.

This applies not just to writing documents but also to meetings or calls. Jot down key points and plan how to present them effectively.

## Choose the Right Moment

Picture this: it's 6 PM on a Friday. Some coworkers are packing up, eager to start the weekend. This isn’t the best time to ask for a code
