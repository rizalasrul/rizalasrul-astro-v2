## Why Consistency Matters

Three weeks later, three boxes of kale popped up using a wick hydroponic system. A week after that, they were all dead—the owner left town and never followed up.

One delay turned into another: late-night meetings, rainy afternoons, lost motivation. Before you know it, another plan bites the dust.

It's so easy to start something. It's way harder to keep showing up.

To avoid letting myself down again and again, I started doing some self-reflection. I realized I needed to build habits and find ways to keep myself accountable.

Here are two simple stories that helped me get there.

## Writing Weekly on Medium

Back in early 2020, I challenged myself to write one post a week—48 total by the end of the year.

Writing helped me think clearly and explore new tech. But after a few months, I stopped. Life got busy, motivation faded.

Then this showed up on my LinkedIn:

| **Someone found value in my post** |

That small message was all I needed to get back at it.

I also started using the hashtag **#xof48** to stay on track. I didn’t know how many I'd finish, but I set a clear goal. That made all the difference.

## Running Again, Slowly but Surely

Last month, my office friends started a running challenge. Everyone set their own monthly goal—10, 20, even 100 km.

Me? I picked 10 km. Just putting on my shoes and going outside felt like progress.

I broke it down simply: run 4 times a month using a 1–2–3–4 km format. And it worked—I hit my 10 km goal.

| **First goal: completed** |

This month, I upped the goal to 15 km—but I plan to go beyond that. The mindset? **Under promise, over deliver.**

So far, I’ve run three times with a total of 12.45 km—and the month’s not even over.

Last month, 10 km felt huge. Now, I’ve done more in half the time. That’s what consistency builds.

Real growth takes time. Find a system that works. Keep showing up.

Consistency might just be your secret superpower.

Cheers to all of us in progress—keep going 🙌
