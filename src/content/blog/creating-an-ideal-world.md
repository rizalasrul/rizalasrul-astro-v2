Being a leader isn’t easy – I learned that when I was the class leader in high school. I didn’t even know why I became the leader, and I definitely wasn’t comfortable with the responsibility. It’s not that I didn’t want responsibility, I just didn’t want to be in charge.

I used to think I could just be average.

I felt like I was doing my part in society by staying passive – after all, everyone has their role, right? There are others who are happy to lead, so I can just go with the flow. If everyone wanted to lead, it would be chaotic.

But if something personal is at stake, I’ll step up.

So, what can I do to create a better world for everyone? I can start by doing my part in things I believe in. Like, I hate waiting for late people, so I make sure I’m not late and don’t keep others waiting. It’s all about treating others how you want to be treated.
