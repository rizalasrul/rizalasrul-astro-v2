Picked up some simple but solid advice from a book I read — basically, things *not* to do if you want a better life:

1. **Stop complaining**, even to yourself. No one likes a constant complainer.  
2. **Don’t brag** about your personal growth. Just show it through your actions.  
3. **Don’t overdo it** with food or drinks. Keep things in balance.  
4. **Don’t talk more than you listen.** You’ve got two ears and one mouth — use them accordingly.  
5. **Don’t run from challenges.** Growth comes from facing hard stuff head-on.

Avoid these, and life might just feel a bit smoother.
