Technology can help with health too! **Eye Care** is a simple expert system that gives users suggestions based on eye symptoms theyâ€™re experiencing. It can also support doctors in making better decisions for their patients.

Hereâ€™s how it works:  
The app asks users a few questions about the symptoms they feel in their eyes. Based on their answers, the system will try to detect what kind of eye issue they might have, and then suggest ways to prevent it from getting worse.

Besides that, the app also gives information about different eye diseases â€” so users can learn more while getting advice.

This project was built using **Java** (with NetBeans 7.4) and a **SQL database**. It was created as a final assignment for the 3rd semester Object-Based Programming course at the State Electronics Polytechnic of Surabaya.

Hopefully in the future, it can be improved to be even more helpful and accurate for both users and doctors.
