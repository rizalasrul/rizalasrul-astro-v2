These days, our biggest challenge is something we can't even see — the Covid-19 virus. But even though it's invisible, it brings something just as real: **fear**.

Fear is natural. It’s built into us. And when fear hits, we usually have two options: **fight** or **flight**.

Sometimes, fear holds us back. Like when someone says,  

> Don’t go through that alley, it’s dark and scary. 

Or,  

> Don’t get into stocks — you’ll lose millions, just like Mr. X.

So, in tough times like now, which one do we choose? Fight? Or flight?

For me — it’s both.

## How I Fight:

1. **Exercise regularly** — even if it’s short, the key is staying consistent.
2. **Eat healthy and on time.**
3. **Keep learning new things** — it can be from YouTube, Udemy, or even TikTok. Yup, TikTok!  
   Check out [Gary Vee](https://www.tiktok.com/@garyvee) — he's super active and inspiring there.
4. **Get enough sleep.**
5. **Stay home if you can.** If you must go out, shower and change clothes once you're back.
6. Follow the **5M** health rules:  
   **M**ask up, **W**ash hands, **K**eep distance, **A**void crowds, and **L**imit mobility.
7. **Use the WFH opportunity** if your company allows it.
8. And lastly, **pray** — ask for protection and strength.

## When I Choose Flight:

Sometimes, we just need to step back — especially when things are out of our control.

And that’s okay.

The key is: **don’t stay in that “flight” state too long**. Instead, look around and focus on the things *you* can control — your mindset, your habits, and your surroundings.

It’s not always easy, but we can try. And trying is already a win.
