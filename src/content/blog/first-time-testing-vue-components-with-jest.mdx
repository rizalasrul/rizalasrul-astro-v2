Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  
Recently at work, all engineers were encouraged to write unit tests for their code. It was actually my first time writing unit tests for Vue components, so I want to share how I did it â€” in a simple way that hopefully helps you get started too.

## Why I Picked Jest

I used **Jest** to write unit tests for Vue. Itâ€™s popular and comes with nice features like:

- Almost zero config needed
- Runs tests fast and in parallel
- Supports code coverage
- Snapshot testing
- Easy mocking

Plus, most of my teammates were already using it â€” so that made it easier to learn.

Other options you might explore are [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html), [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), or [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/).

## Setting Up the Project

Letâ€™s start by creating a basic Vue project using Vue CLI:

```bash
npm install -g vue-cli
vue init webpack vue-test
cd vue-test
```

Install the testing tools:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest vue-jest babel-jest vue-test-utils
```

Update your `package.json` with this Jest config:

```json
"jest": {
  "moduleNameMapper": {
    "^vue$": "vue/dist/vue.common.js"
  },
  "moduleFileExtensions": ["js", "vue"],
  "transform": {
    "^.+\\.js$": "babel-jest",
    ".*\\.(vue)$": "vue-jest"
  }
}
```

And add a test script:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
}
```

## A Simple Component to Test

Here's a basic Vue component called `NegoButton.vue`:

```javascript
<template>
  <button
    :disabled="idDisabled"
    :class="{ 'is-active': isTransacting }"
    @click.prevent="pay"
  >
    <span>Yuk Nego</span>
  </button>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'NegoButton',
  props: {
    idDisabled: Boolean,
    isTransacting: Boolean,
  },
  methods: {
    pay() {
      // some logic here
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

## Writing Your First Test

Letâ€™s create a test file: `NegoButton.spec.js` (you can put this in `src/components/test/`).

```javascript
import NegoButton from '../NegoButton';

describe('NegoButton.vue', () => {
  it('should have the correct name', () => {
    expect(NegoButton.name).toBe('NegoButton');
  });
});
```

Run the test:

```bash
npm run test
```

If everything works, youâ€™ll see it pass! âœ…

## Using vue-test-utils + Snapshots

Now letâ€™s use vue-test-utils to render the component and do snapshot testing:

```javascript
import { shallowMount } from '@vue/test-utils';
import NegoButton from '../NegoButton';

describe('NegoButton.vue', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {
    const wrapper = shallowMount(NegoButton);
    expect(wrapper.element).toMatchSnapshot();
  });
});
```

Snapshot tests help you catch unexpected changes to the HTML structure of a component. If the HTML changes, Jest will tell you. To update the snapshot if the change is expected:

```bash
npm run test -u
```

That's it! ðŸŽ‰<br />
Now youâ€™ve got a working setup to start testing Vue components. You can add more tests to check things like button clicks, prop behavior, or event emissions.

Let me know if youâ€™d like an example for testing @emit or other features!
