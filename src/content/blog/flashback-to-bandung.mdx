Can’t believe I’m already halfway through the #30DayWritingChallenge. Honestly had no idea what to write today — until Facebook threw a memory at me.

This pic was taken around 2017 in front of my old office in Bandung. It instantly brought back memories of the time I spent there, so I started digging through old photos.

## My Old Boarding House

<img src={flashbackImage3.src} alt="My old boarding house" />
<img src={flashbackImage4.src} alt="My old boarding house" />

I stayed here for over a year. It was basically my everything — my chill zone on weekends, holidays, and even workdays.

## Gadobangkong Station

This was the nearest station from my place, so I used it all the time to get around by local train.

## Farmhouse, Lembang

<img src={flashbackImage8.src} alt="Farmhouse" />
<img src={flashbackImage9.src} alt="Farmhouse" />

One day I decided to travel solo to Lembang using public transport. First stop: the Farmhouse. Bought a ticket, got a glass of milk, and explored every corner of the place.

## Floating Market

<img src={flashbackImage11.src} alt="Floating Market" />
<img src={flashbackImage12.src} alt="Floating Market" />
<img src={flashbackImage13.src} alt="Floating Market" />
<img src={flashbackImage14.src} alt="Floating Market" />
<img src={flashbackImage15.src} alt="Floating Market" />

Next stop was the Floating Market — just a short ride from Farmhouse. The coolest part? A bunch of food stalls floating above a reservoir. Super chill vibes.

## Gasibu

Used to go jogging here on weekend mornings. Always lively, always refreshing.

## Pangalengan Cattle Farm

<img src={flashbackImage18.src} alt="Cattle farm in Pangalengan" />
<img src={flashbackImage19.src} alt="Cattle farm in Pangalengan" />
<img src={flashbackImage20.src} alt="Cattle farm in Pangalengan" />
<img src={flashbackImage21.src} alt="Cattle farm in Pangalengan" />

My old company owned this cattle farm in Pangalengan. I visited a few times for stock opname events. Beautiful place, and quite the experience.
