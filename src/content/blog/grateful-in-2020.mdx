2021 just started, and I wanted to take a moment to look back at 2020. It was a tough year for everyone, but there were still things worth being thankful for. This post is my way of remembering the good stuff â€” big or small â€” that happened to me last year.

## Started Writing Again

One thing Iâ€™m happy about is getting back into writing. I started on Medium, but then moved all the posts to my personal site.

My first post in 2020 was about working at a tech startup, especially my experience at Bukalapak. If you're curious, [read it here](/blog/life-at-a-tech-startup/).

Writing helps me learn better. Turning thoughts into words makes ideas stick. So instead of keeping things in my head, I blog about them.

## Office Staycation Before Covid Hit

Right before the pandemic reached Indonesia, our team had a staycation in Lembang.

We stayed at Villa Aloka for a night â€” it was fun and really brought the team closer.

## Transition to Full WFH

When the pandemic hit, Bukalapak quickly shifted to full work-from-home. Thankfully, we were already used to remote work, but this time it was permanent.

I learned a lot about communicating clearly in writing â€” whether in chat, email, or docs. It made me a better teammate and engineer.

## Released Kartu Prakerja

Our first big project during WFH was Kartu Prakerja. It was chaotic â€” unclear requirements, tight deadlines, adapting to remote work â€” but we pulled through.

We launched ahead of competitors, and users could use their cards at Bukalapak first. That was a proud moment.

## Released BukaRumah

We also launched BukaRumah, a collab between Bukalapak and Bank Mandiri for online home loan applications.

Despite working remotely, the team delivered on time. Check out the product [here](https://bukalapak.com/bukarumah).

## Became a Webinar Speaker

It started with an invite from a college friend for a campus FGD session. From there, more speaking gigs came in.

- Shared Vue at Anak Teknik Academy

- Guest lectured at POLTEKBA

- Talked about async JavaScript at PENS

Never thought Iâ€™d be back speaking again â€” but Iâ€™m glad I did.

## Stayed Covid-Free

Super grateful that my family and I stayed safe from COVID. Working from home really helped minimize exposure.

Hope you all stayed healthy too.

## Kept Investing

I kept up my investments in stocks and government bonds.

When the market dropped early in the pandemic, I took the chance to invest in solid stocks. I also bought SR012 and ORI018 bonds, and kept up with mutual funds too.

## Got Into Running

Never thought Iâ€™d get into running, but here I am â€” 100KM in 4 months!

It started as a monthly challenge with office friends. First 10KM, then 15KM, and it just kept going.
