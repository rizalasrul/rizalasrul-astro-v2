Writing a gratitude list at the end of the year has kind of become a routine for me.

Just like 2020, we’re still living in a pandemic. In fact, things got really bad in Indonesia this year — probably the worst so far. There was sad news everywhere, even from people close to me.

2021 was a tough year personally too. My brother got Covid and had to isolate at Wisma Atlet. I lost a friend. Many others around me were affected as well. It was depressing — for everyone.

Still, as I look back from January to now, I realize there are things I can be grateful for. Even in difficult times, there are always small things to appreciate.

## Working from home

I’ve been working from home all year. My company decided early on that we’d continue WFH for 2021.

And honestly, I’m super thankful for that. Working from home has been great for flexibility, saving money, and even improving how I communicate.

## Got promoted

This year I got promoted! I felt happy, of course, but also a bit unsure about what to do next.

Luckily, my manager and lead were really helpful. They gave me a lot of direct feedback and support in our 1-on-1s.

## Worked on the SIPLah project

I got pulled into the SIPLah project for a few months mid-year. It’s a platform created by the Ministry of Education to help schools with procurement.

The project was challenging — lots of changing requirements and new processes to learn. But I learned a lot and grew from the experience.

## Azure migration experience

Bukalapak partnered with Microsoft, and we started migrating services to Azure.

I got the chance to work on this project. I migrated two micro-frontends and mentored another engineer as a cloud coach. It was cool working with new people from outside my squad.

## Learned about tech debt management

I used to think the only way to handle tech debt was to pay it off ASAP.

But this year, I joined an internal training on managing tech debt — and it changed my perspective. I learned how to measure complexity, prioritize, and present the info clearly to stakeholders.

## Spoke at Kemah Budaya Kaum Muda

In July, I was invited to speak at a webinar held by the Ministry of Education. It was part of an event called Kemah Budaya Kaum Muda (KBKM).

It was a fun experience sharing my thoughts on software engineering and how we build impactful tech quickly.

## Read more books

Like I shared in the previous post, I read way more books this year than last year. I even made mini summaries and posted them on Instagram. Hope I can keep it up next year!

## Wrote more

This blog helped me write more consistently. I also wrote more at work — RFCs, SADs, and documentation.

Writing turned out to be a big part of software engineering. It’s not just about code.

## Got vaccinated

My whole family got vaccinated this year. My company helped organize a smooth vaccination process for employees and their families. Super grateful for that.

## Discovered great podcasts

I’ve been listening to more podcasts than music while working from home. Some favorites: *Endgame* by Gita Wirjawan and *Tech Lead Journal* by Henry Suryawirawan. Highly recommend!

## Went back to the cinema

I didn’t go to the movies at all last year, but finally went again this year. Thought *Spider-Man: No Way Home* would be the first one — turns out it was *Venom: Let There Be Carnage*.

## Still investing

I’m thankful I could continue investing. I even opened another account this year to reach new financial goals. Hoping I can stay consistent with this habit.

## Health

Despite everything, my family and I stayed healthy. My wife and I didn’t catch Covid. That’s something I’ll always be grateful for.

I’m sure you also have your own list of things to be thankful for. Let’s carry that gratitude into the new year.
