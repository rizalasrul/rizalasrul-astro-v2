> Everyone makes mistakes — it's part of growing as an engineer.

Even after all the hard work, sometimes bugs still make it to production and cause issues. It sucks, but it's normal. What matters is how we handle it.

A while back, not long after I joined Bukalapak, I introduced a bug that broke electricity token payments on the desktop site. I had built a recurring transaction feature for postpaid electricity and tested everything locally and on staging. It all looked good.

What I missed? That the page I was working on also handled **prepaid** electricity tokens. I didn’t test that part. Boom — token payments stopped working.

Here’s what I learned about how to deal with emergencies like this:

## Stay Calm

Don’t panic. It’s tempting to rush, but that can make things worse. Take a breath (or sip that coffee), then move with a clear head.

## Talk to Your Team

> Not every emergency is urgent.

Let your PM or team lead know what's happening. If it’s really urgent and you already have a fix ready, go for it — but only if it's small and safe. If not, wait for directions.

At Bukalapak, we look at the GMV or revenue impact to decide how urgent a bug is.

## Test Thoroughly

Even in a rush, never skip testing. Try your fix locally, on staging, preprod, or even beta production if needed. Ask QA for help, and add unit tests if possible.

Test until you're confident.

## Ask for Help

If your squad is stuck, don’t hesitate to reach out to senior engineers or other teams. You’re not alone.

## Monitor After Deploy

Once the fix is live, double-check everything. Monitor logs, metrics, and ask your lead for a second pair of eyes if needed.

## Share What You Learned

Don’t keep it to yourself. Share your story — in chat, meetings, or docs. Your experience can help others avoid the same mistake.

Mistakes are part of the job. Learning and growing from them is what really matters.
