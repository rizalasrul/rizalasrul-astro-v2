A while back, social media was buzzing with hot takes on work-life balance.  
Some said it’s real. Others dismissed it as a myth.

Most of the loudest voices? Entrepreneurs, influencers, creators — people with big followings. And they often spoke from their own lens: *"Work-life balance doesn’t exist!"*  

But what about regular employees? People with smaller followings whose voices aren’t as amplified online?

From their perspective, balance might mean simply logging off after office hours. And maybe that’s just as valid.

Today, the line between “work” and “life” is blurred. You might scroll TikTok during working hours, and later check Slack while lying on the beach.

For entrepreneurs, balance doesn’t mean 9-to-5. It’s more like living with a constant sense of urgency — even on vacation. But that doesn’t mean they’re out of balance. It just looks different.

For others, balance might mean working fixed shifts. Some do night shifts, then spend the morning living their life. That’s still balance — just not the influencer version.

As for me, I have flexibility. Some days I work five hours, other days twelve.  
Sometimes I run in the afternoon, work in the evening.  
Balance, for me, is about putting things in their right place.  

In the end, work-life balance is personal. There’s no one-size-fits-all.

Find your own balance — and protect it.
