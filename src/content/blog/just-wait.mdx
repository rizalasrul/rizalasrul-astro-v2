You don’t always need to have an opinion.  
Sometimes, the best response is: *just wait and see*.

It’s not the events themselves that stress us out — it’s our judgment of them.  
And often, we judge too early, with incomplete information.

So take a breath.  
Let time do its thing.  
Let the facts come in.  
Let the moment pass.

You’ll know soon enough if something’s good or bad.  
Until then, no need to react.  
Just relax.
