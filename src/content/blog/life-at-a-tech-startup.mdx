When people talk about working at a startup, it’s easy to imagine fancy offices and lightning-fast innovation. But before we dive into what it feels like, let’s first ask — what exactly is a startup?

> Startups are businesses that seek to solve a problem with a solution that has not been tested, has not been scalable, or has not been proven to be financially sustainable.  
> — Muhamad Fajrin Rasyid, President & Co-founder of Bukalapak

In short, startups are all about **building something new**, something that hasn’t been proven yet. Unlike opening a restaurant or supermarket — where the business model is well-known — startups are betting on ideas that might or might not work.

This is why **innovation** is at the core of every startup. You’re not just building features, you’re solving real-world problems in new ways. That means you need both creativity and logic, and lots of curiosity.

## Quality Always Matters

Startups are all about experimenting, which is why they need great people — folks who are skilled, curious, and always learning. If you want to be part of this world, you’ve got to keep your skills sharp and stay updated with the latest tech.

Let’s say you were building websites in 2009. Back then, everything was desktop-first. Fast forward to now, and mobile-first is the norm. That’s a huge shift — and you have to keep up if you want to stay relevant. Online courses, tech meetups, or just chatting with colleagues can go a long way in keeping you sharp.

## Understanding the Culture

Technical skills are one thing, but knowing how to work in a startup environment is just as important. Culture varies from company to company, but there are some patterns that show up in almost every startup.

### Experimentation is Key

Startups love experiments. You’ll usually get a general direction and then have the freedom to figure out how to get there. That freedom comes with responsibility — you’re expected to manage your time, own your tasks, and stay professional.

At Bukalapak, one of the core values is **try, fail, and try again**. You’re encouraged to experiment and learn from mistakes. Another is **go the extra mile** — meaning you don’t stop at “good enough”; you keep pushing to make things even better.

### Fast-Paced Work

Most startups move fast. They often use agile methods to quickly test ideas and deliver results. It might feel intense at first, but you’ll be surprised at how much you can learn in a short time.

I learned more in my first three months at Bukalapak than I did in an entire year at a previous job — all thanks to the rapid learning environment.

Technology and responsibilities change fast too. The skills you have today might need to evolve in just a few months, so adaptability is key.

### Teamwork Makes the Dream Work

Startups are super collaborative. You’ll usually work with a mix of different roles — backend devs, frontend devs, mobile engineers, QA testers, data scientists, and of course, product and engineering managers.

That means empathy and communication matter a lot. It’s not just about getting your part done — it’s about helping the whole team succeed.

This is just based on my experience — every startup is different. So if you’re thinking about joining one, or you’re already in one, take the time to observe and understand the culture. The better you get at reading the environment, the better you’ll thrive.
