If you want to grow, you’ve gotta be okay with looking clueless sometimes.

That means:

1. **Ask the “dumb” questions**  
   You don’t learn if you don’t ask. Don’t let fear of looking silly stop you. It’s fine to say, “I don’t know about that,” or “I’m not following that topic.”

2. **Be bad before you get good**  
   Everyone starts somewhere. Being a beginner, messing up, and figuring things out awkwardly—that’s part of the process.

The Stoics said it best: if you want to improve, you have to be willing to look stupid. That’s how you get from where you are to where you want to go.
