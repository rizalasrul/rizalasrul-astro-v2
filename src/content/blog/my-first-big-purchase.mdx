Facebook reminded me of an old photo today.

It brought me back to the time when my dad came home holding *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*.  
At first, he bought it for himself. But every night, he’d read it aloud to me, and I became hooked.

From then on, whenever a new Harry Potter book was released, my dad bought it for us to read together.  
Since there was only one copy, we had to make a reading schedule so no one fought over it.

Then came book six — *The Half-Blood Prince* — my favorite one.  
When I finished it, I knew I had to buy the final book, *The Deathly Hallows*, with my own money. It felt like a big deal. I saved up from Eid packets and pocket money.

Eventually, I made it happen.

So yeah — the first expensive thing I ever bought was a book. And not just any book, but the ending of a magical journey I grew up with.
