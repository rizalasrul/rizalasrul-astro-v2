The second phase of ethical hacking is **network scanning** — this is when a hacker (or ethical hacker) checks a target network to find active devices, open ports, and running services.

In socket-based programming, the **server** is the one that provides a service, and the **client** is the one that uses it. A **socket** is basically an IP address + a port number. For example, an email service might use the socket `202.9.85.49:25`.

In this phase, we’ll try **port scanning**, which means checking which ports are open on a host.

Why does this matter? Because **network services can be vulnerable**. Some services have weak spots like bad code, weak passwords, unencrypted data, or allowing connections from anywhere. These can all be entry points for attackers. That’s why it's best to **only keep necessary ports open** to reduce the risk.

There are several ways to scan using **Nmap**, such as:

- **Connect scan** (`-sT`)
- **TCP SYN scan** (`-sS`)
- **TCP FIN scan** (`-sF`)
- **TCP Xmas Tree scan** (`-sX`)
- **TCP Null scan** (`-sN`)
- **TCP ACK scan** (`-sA`)
- **TCP Window scan**
- **TCP RPC scan**
