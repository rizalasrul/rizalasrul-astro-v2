I don’t need to have an opinion on everything.

I can let things be.  
I can ignore what doesn’t concern me.  
I can choose to observe instead of judge.

It doesn’t have to be good or bad, fair or unfair.  
It can just… be.  
I don’t need to add my thoughts, beliefs, or labels to it.

It exists.  
That’s enough.  
No opinion needed.
