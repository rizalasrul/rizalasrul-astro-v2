Regret can be tough, but it’s also part of what has shaped me into who I am today.

Honestly, I don’t have many regrets because I think regretting the past is pointless. Every experience teaches me something.

I try to focus on today and tomorrow.

But if I had to pick one regret, it would be **time**.

Time is something we can’t get back. I feel regret when I feel like I haven’t used my time well enough.

For example, I may have spent time with someone, but who knows—it could have been the last time. Sometimes, paths diverge, and there’s no future meeting because we’re living in different worlds now.
