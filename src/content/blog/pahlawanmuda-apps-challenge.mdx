After a long break from blogging, Iâ€™m finally back with something fun to share!

On November 15, 2015, I joined an exciting event called the **#PahlawanMuda Apps Challenge** at Telkom Ketintang. It was hosted by KPU Surabaya to welcome the upcoming mayoral election on December 9, 2015.

The challenge had five competition categories â€” and my team joined the **disability category**. We built an app to help people with visual impairments access objective info about the mayoral candidates.

Our app is called **TRC** (Text Recognition for Candidate). It's a simple app that uses **text recognition** technology from [Vuforia](https://developer.vuforia.com/downloads/sdk).

After a week of waiting, judging day finally came. Each category had its top five teams present their apps. It was amazing to meet fellow developers and industry experts.

Even cooler â€” for our category, people with visual impairments got to try out the apps directly!

The judging was done in two rounds. First, each team presented at their booth while judges walked around and tested the apps. Then, the top 9 teams were announced for the final round.

In the second round, we had to present in front of all judges and participants. There were so many cool apps made by other teams â€” super inspiring!

My team didnâ€™t win this time, but the good news is one of my friends won in the **Game and Monitoring** category. ðŸŽ‰
