When we were kids, we had a catalog of possible professions. From doctors and pilots to astronauts and ministers. As a kid, I chose to be an astronaut because I wanted to see outer space and the stars.

When I reached junior high, my dream shifted to becoming a doctor. I thought being a doctor was noble because you could heal the sick. Plus, I was influenced by family members working in the healthcare field.

Then, in high school, my passion shifted again when my parents bought me a Playstation 2. I spent hours playing it, and while playing GTA San Andreas, I thought, "Wow, it's amazing that people made a game this complex and fun!" That's when I got interested in becoming a game developer. I discovered the term "programmer" and realized that's what I wanted to be—to create games.

In college, I dove deep into game development. I joined the game development community, participated in competitions, and made game development my final project.

*Me and my final project*

However, my first job didn’t land me in game development but as an IT staff. My task was to develop websites, which made me relearn web technologies I had touched in college. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it.

Today, I’m still passionate about my role as a web developer.

Looking back, I realize my passions have evolved. It doesn’t mean I failed to find my passion; rather, I’ve successfully explored different passions.

Finding your passion is a never-ending journey. Right now, I’m a web developer at an e-commerce company, but who knows? In the future, I might discover a new career that excites me. The key is to stay open.

What if career paths aren't just about going up, but also moving sideways?
