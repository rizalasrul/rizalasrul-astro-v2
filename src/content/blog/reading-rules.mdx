Here are a few personal rules I follow when it comes to reading:

1. **Read often.** The more you read, the better it gets.
2. **Don’t fall for speed reading.** It sounds cool, but it doesn’t work. Good reading takes time.
3. **Old books are usually better.** They’ve stood the test of time for a reason.
4. **Quit bad books.** Life’s too short. Follow the [100 pages minus your age rule](https://medium.com/@stevenrushing/big-fan-of-the-rule-of-thumb-100-pages-minus-your-age-b56cec263f1c).
5. **Take notes.** If you're just rushing to finish, you're missing the point.
6. **Let one book lead to another.** Every good book should point you to the next one.
7. **Apply what you read.** Ask yourself: *“How can I use this in real life?”* Reading isn’t about looking smart — it’s about growing.
8. **Share good books.** If it made an impact, pass it on.

That’s it — simple but useful.
