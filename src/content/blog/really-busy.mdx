We all say we're busy. But how much of that stuff *actually* matters?

Try asking yourself: **"Is this essential?"**  
Most of what we do isn’t. It’s just stuff we do because someone asked us, told us, or because we’ve always done it that way.

But if you knew tomorrow was your last day, would you still do it? Would you do it the same way?

When you start asking “Is this essential?” — about everything you do, say, or even think — you start to cut the fluff. You get to focus on what really matters. You end up doing fewer things, but doing them way better.

So next time you're overwhelmed, pause and ask:  
**Do I really need to be doing this?**  
**Is this the best way to do it?**
