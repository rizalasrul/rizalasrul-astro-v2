Need to manage a server without sitting right in front of it? You can do that easily using **SSH** (short for Secure Shell), a network protocol that lets you securely access another computer over a network.

In this guide, Iâ€™ll show you how to remotely control a server from a client computer using SSH. Here's the basic flow:

### Steps to Remotely Access a Server with SSH

import image2 from '/src/assets/remote-server-with-ssh-2.png';
import image3 from '/src/assets/remote-server-with-ssh-3.png';
import image4 from '/src/assets/remote-server-with-ssh-4.png';
import image5 from '/src/assets/remote-server-with-ssh-5.png';
import image6 from '/src/assets/remote-server-with-ssh-6.png';
import image7 from '/src/assets/remote-server-with-ssh-7.png';
import image8 from '/src/assets/remote-server-with-ssh-8.png';
import image9 from '/src/assets/remote-server-with-ssh-9.png';
import image10 from '/src/assets/remote-server-with-ssh-10.png';
import image11 from '/src/assets/remote-server-with-ssh-11.png';

1. **Login to the server**
   The server IP address in this example is `10.252.108.76`. 
   <img src={image1.src} alt="Screenshot 1" /> 

2. **Login as root user**
   <img src={image2.src} alt="Screenshot 2" /> 

3. **Check the server's current IP address**
   <img src={image3.src} alt="Screenshot 3" />

4. **Update the server**
   <img src={image4.src} alt="Screenshot 4" />

5. **Check memory usage**
   <img src={image5.src} alt="Screenshot 5" />

6. **Check hard drive space**
   <img src={image6.src} alt="Screenshot 6" />

7. **View disk partitions**
   <img src={image7.src} alt="Screenshot 7" />

8. **Check CPU status**
   <img src={image8.src} alt="Screenshot 8" />

9. **View the default gateway**
   <img src={image9.src} alt="Screenshot 9" />

10. **Change the serverâ€™s IP address**
   To do this, edit the file located at `/etc/network/interfaces`.
   <img src={image10.src} alt="Screenshot 10" /> 

11. **Confirm the new IP address**
   Once it's changed, youâ€™ll see the updated IP.
   <img src={image11.src} alt="Screenshot 11" />

Thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™ve just managed a server remotely using SSH. ðŸš€  
Great for updates, monitoring, and quick fixes without needing physical access.
