There's this great story Simon Sinek tells about two lumberjacks.

Both start chopping wood at the same time every morning and stop at the same time every evening. But one of them disappears for an hour in the middle of the day — yet he always ends up chopping more wood. After a while, the other guy finally asks, “Where do you go every day?” The answer? “I go home and sharpen my axe.”

That’s it. We all need to sharpen our axes sometimes.

You don’t need to go on a fancy trip to take time off. Here’s why taking a break — even if you stay home — actually matters:

1. Sometimes, you just need rest. That’s it.
2. Feeling at home (physically *and* mentally) is underrated.
3. Being truly present with family — no Slack, no emails — is valuable.
4. A clear mind brings better ideas at work.
5. Not all vacations are restful. Some are just... tiring and expensive.

So yeah, take that day off. Even if it’s just to do nothing.
