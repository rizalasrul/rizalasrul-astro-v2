New year, new goals — but no new resolutions for me this time.  
I just want to be a better version of myself.

Honestly, I started the year pretty chill. Woke up early, binge-watched *Iron Fist*, and now I’m writing this post.

This is a reflection based on feedback I’ve received from my wife, family, coworkers, lead, manager — basically, people I’ve worked and lived with.

Here are three areas I’d like to work on:

---

## 1. Being *too* frugal

Saving money is great, but I tend to take it too far.  
My wife has pointed this out a few times — like when I insist on buying cheaper stuff, even if the quality isn’t great.

One example: I bought a watch for under 100k IDR. It looked nice and was super cheap, but it broke after a year.  
Sometimes it’s worth paying a bit more for better quality, and that’s something I need to learn.

---

## 2. Multitasking the wrong things

I’ve caught myself juggling too many small, unimportant tasks at once.  
It doesn’t help — I just end up overthinking and giving myself a headache.

Focus is something I need to improve.

---

## 3. Hiding in the background

Back in school, I’d avoid raising my hand even when I knew the answer — just to stay unnoticed.  
I guess I was shy or just didn’t want attention.

That habit followed me into work. But one day, my lead gave me solid feedback, and since then I’ve been trying to speak up more — sharing opinions and giving input in public settings.

Happy new year — hope 2022 brings growth and good things for all of us!
