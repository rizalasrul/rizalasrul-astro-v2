Since 2020, I’ve been lucky to work from home — less stress, comfy clothes, and more savings. Tech has made it easy to stay productive, run meetings, and keep in touch with my team.

But after meeting my colleagues in person again, I realized how much easier it is to build trust when you’ve already worked together face-to-face. Many companies now go fully remote, and while it works, it’s tough to form strong connections with people you’ve never met.

Trust isn’t built in meetings — it’s built between them. In small talks, lunch breaks, random chats. Online, that’s hard. No quick catch-ups after meetings, no casual hallway convos.

So if you're going remote, you need to be intentional: schedule virtual coffee chats, team hangouts, or even plan yearly in-person meetups. Trust needs time and effort — just like brushing your teeth, a little every day goes a long way.
