I’m not a manager — this is just based on things I’ve picked up from books, podcasts, and personal observation.

Here’s what I think most managers want from their team:

1. **Be accountable.** They don’t want to micromanage you.
2. **Understand your KPIs and OKRs.** And know how to work toward them.
3. **Be on their side.** Support the mission, not resist it.
4. **Avoid toxic behavior.** Don’t spread negativity in the team.
5. **Over-deliver.** Do more than what’s expected when you can.
6. **Be a team player.** Don’t just focus on your own tasks — help where it matters.

That’s it. Just some quick thoughts.
