As I shared in [this post](/blog/books-i-read-in-2021/), I recently read *Inspired: How To Create Tech Products Customers Love* by Marty Cagan.

The book shares tons of insight for new product managers, drawn from Cagan’s years of experience in product. I highly recommend it if you’re interested in PM work.

But as an engineer, I found something else valuable — a glimpse into what product managers actually need from us in day-to-day work.

While the book focuses on PMs, it indirectly teaches engineers how to make life easier for their PMs.

Here are a few key takeaways:

---

### 1. Give thoughtful feedback

When a PM shares a problem statement — usually via a PRD — they don’t just want agreement. They want us to think critically and challenge the idea when needed.

---

### 2. Speak up

Don’t be a “yes person.” PMs know engineers are often the smartest folks on the team. If you have concerns or suggestions, say something. Good communication matters.  
I’ve talked more about that [here](/blog/communicating-as-an-engineer/).

---

### 3. Be confident

When a PM asks a question, it’s because they want to understand — not test you. So just answer it calmly and clearly. No need to stress.

---

I hope we can all build better relationships with our PMs — and build better products together.
