Just to be clear — I'm *not* planning to resign.

But with the new year kicking off, it feels like the job-hunting season is opening again. A lot of people start thinking about switching jobs. That got me reflecting: what would make *me* consider leaving a company?

Here are a few things that come to mind:

## 1. When the pay doesn't cut it anymore

This one’s pretty straightforward. I know people in this situation — and I’ve been there too.

Sure, managing your expenses is one way to go. But sometimes, no matter how much you budget, your salary just doesn’t match your needs.

You *can* try asking for a raise, and sometimes that works. But if it doesn’t, then yeah, it might be time to look around.

## 2. When the industry has no future

Sometimes it’s not just about changing companies — you might need to switch industries too.

I made this move myself. I used to work in FMCG, where the core business was food and beverages. As an IT guy, tech wasn't the main focus there.

To grow and stay sharp in tech, I knew I had to jump into the tech industry. That’s why I moved to Bukalapak.

## 3. When the company culture turns toxic

Culture shifts are rare, but they *do* happen — maybe because of a leadership change or new business direction.

Not every shift leads to toxicity, but if things get bad and the environment becomes unhealthy, it’s hard to stay motivated. If work starts to feel heavy every single day, that’s a big sign it might be time to go.

## 4. When a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity comes up

Sometimes, you get an offer that’s just too good to ignore — better role, bigger salary, or a learning opportunity you’d never get where you are now.

Sure, in a perfect world your current company could give you those chances. But realistically, some things just aren’t possible where you are — like working with global teams when your company only operates locally.
